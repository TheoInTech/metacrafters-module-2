# `Final Project in Solana`

> Solana dApps. Learned about Node Providers and how to connect/disconnect Phantom wallet, transfer and airdrop SOL.

### Install
Make sure to do `yarn` or `npm install` at the root directory, not in this package.

Go back to this package directory of the challenge.

`cd packages/final-project`

and run the index.js using node

`yarn start`

### Requirements

Your final challenge for this module is to create a mini-project based on what you have learned.

Here are the instructions for the mini-project:

- Create a front end with a small button titled “Create a new Solana account” that generates a new KeyPair at the backend and airdrops 2 SOL to the newly created Keypair.

- Once this step is completed, create another button that says - “Connect to Phantom Wallet”, which should connect to the Phantom Wallet if it exists, else point to a link where the user can install the extension.

- Once this step is completed, add a button called “Transfer to new wallet”. This button should trigger a transfer of 2 SOL (airdropped into the account you generated in step 1) to the account connected in Step 2.

You can have all the 3 buttons on the same page or on different pages - that’s completely up to you. It is not mandatory to have a great design but rather functionality is the prime focus area.
